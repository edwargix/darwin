# Darwin

A Darwin Frog is a small species of frog and as such the purpose of this project is to pick up the great work Greg did with [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog), simplifying and improving it as much as possible.

Darwin is a static web site generator written in [Racket][].

You write content in [Markdown][] or [Scribble][]. You generate
files. To deploy, you push them to a GitHub Pages repo (or copy them
to Amazon S3, or whatever).

Posts get a variety of automatic blog features.

You can also create non-post pages.

[Pygments][] handles syntax highlighting for code blocks.

The generated site uses [Bootstrap][], which is [responsive][],
automatically adapting to various screen sizes.
